# html-to-pdf-flask
A simple Flask-based web service that converts HTML to PDF using PDFKit. This application provides an API that accepts HTML content and generates a PDF, returning it as a base64-encoded string. It supports running with both Flask's built-in server for development and uWSGI for production deployment.
